But it's been taken over by... ghosts? Cursed pirates? Let your players clean it out, and then offer them the magically renovated Galleon as a mobile base for their next campaign arc. The normal Galleon is available for free in the module's compendium.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Alternative Layouts</span>: This map is available initially as a \"<strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Multi-scene Map</strong>\".&nbsp; It is meant for parties to go through scene by scene. However, you can always use the scene artwork to recreate all of the levels in a single map, if that's your preference. Use a copy of the \"Galleon Single Map\" from the Compendium as an easy starting point. you'll just need to update all of your Multilevel Token hotspots to a unique map name.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; text-decoration-line: underline;\">Modules in Use</span>:&nbsp;<strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Multilevel Token</strong>&nbsp;hotspots are in place, including the Hold, the Decks and the ocean.&nbsp;<strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Core Foundry Lighting</strong>&nbsp;for green torch fire.

Some on the Decks and a big zone in the water. You can place actors anywhere on this Main Deck screen, and they will \"project\" to the same spot from other screens. This way your players can see each other and enemies from anywhere on the ship (assuming line of sight). You should also be able to target these clones in combat (if you're using the Single Map version).&nbsp;<strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">It is important that you don't drop Actors directly in the \"projected\" hotspots</strong>. They won't project to other areas, and you may lose track of where you put them. Just drop them into the Main Deck screen or one of the rooms.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; text-decoration-line: underline;\">Special Use of Ambient Sounds</span>: In each level of the Galleon you can hear sailing sounds whenever you select a token. These sounds become louder or more muffled as you exit/enter cabins or go further below deck.

There are a few ways this might happen:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Automatic</strong>. Just by a player stepping into a teleport \"zone\", they will zap to the next location</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Click-to-Teleport</strong>: Many teleport zones contain a journal entry. this entry doesn't do or say anyting in particular, but it's there for your players to initiate the teleport when they are standing in the zone. This is to help maintain more control and cut down on the chaos of players accidentally teleporting to other maps.</p>\n<p>Communicate with me anytime at my <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Sb9E3Tu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discord</a> or via <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/baileywiki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patreon</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About Files</h2>\n<p>All of the artwork and sounds can be accessed through the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">data/modules/baileywiki-maps-premium/maps path</span>. Check it out.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why should you care?</p>\n<p>1. There are extra files and easter eggs in there. Often alternatives versions of maps.</p>\n<p>2. You could back up these files somewhere else if you have an important map that you don't want to lose&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How Importing from the Compendium Works</h2>\n<p>When you import an asset like a Scene or an Actor from the Baileywiki Compendium, you're just making a copy of the instructions for the map in your local world. Foundry reads these instructions in order to render the map in your game. The assets themselves (the pictures and sounds), are installed into a special directory within your Foundry modules file structure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you unistall the Baileywiki Module, then you will lose the Compendium. This doesn't affect the Scenes or assets that you've already imported EXCEPT that the artwork and sound files may be lost. When you try to open your Scene, those elements will be missing. For this reason, it's important to backup your modules/baileywiki-maps-premium folders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Communicate with me anytime at my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discord.gg/Sb9E3Tu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discord</a>&nbsp;or via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/baileywiki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patreon</a>.</p>","_id":"GDan6unQpyEy6uiQ"}

This map is available initially as a \"<strong>Single Map</strong>\". While I can deploy it as a multi-scene map, a&nbsp;Single Map might be better for combat and to cut down on load times for your players.

And&nbsp;<strong>FXMaster</strong>&nbsp;for creating lovely clouds rolling by.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Special Use of Multilevel Token</span>: On the main deck are special MLT zones.

You can place actors anywhere on this Main Deck screen, and they will \"project\" to the same spot from other screens.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Special Use of Ambient Sounds</span>: In each level of the Galleon you can hear airship sounds whenever you select a token. These sounds become louder or more muffled as you exit/enter cabins or go further below deck. They are the loudest on the Main Deck outside.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Alternative Layouts</span>: You can use all of the artwork in the module folder to split the Galleon across 6 different scenes, or message me through Patreon if you'd like to see it distributed through the module that way.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Available Upgrades</span></strong>: The main deck of the Airship is free to anyone.

There are relatively mundane levels, like guest rooms, library and dining room, and decidedly sinister and magical levels, like a portal room, a scrying pool and a laboratory where dark experiments have been taking place.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; text-decoration-line: underline;\">Modules in Use</span>:&nbsp;<strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Multilevel Token</strong> hotspots are in place to teleport your players around and to project them from level to another. And&nbsp;<strong>Token Attacher</strong>&nbsp;is useful if you want to drop any of the Tower levels (including walls, lights and sound) into any map or on top of any of the customizable tower \"base\" styles that are available to you (city/cobble, moat/grass, or remote/dirt). Lastly, <strong>CommunityLighting by Blitz</strong> is used to create the electric strobe effect in the laboratory.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; text-decoration-line: underline;\">Special Use of Ambient Sounds</span>: In many of the levels of the Tower, you can hear fire crackling, magic aura's and electrical ambient sounds to help set the mood.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Communicate with me anytime at my&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" href=\"https://discord.gg/Sb9E3Tu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discord</a>&nbsp;or via&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/baileywiki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patreon</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Important DM Notes for Advanced Functionality</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Activating Teleports</span>: Install and activate Multilevel Token. To actually trigger a teleport, a token must be standing in the hot spot and click on the Journal Entry in that zone.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Using the special Teleport Pad from the Actor compendium (requires <strong>Token Attacher</strong> module and <strong>Multielevel Token</strong> Module)</span>: You can drag a TP pad from the compendium onto you map. Then you can edit it there to point to any destination you want. It comes with sound, lights and even the Multilevel Token area and journal entry required to function. You just need to edit the distination!</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Import All Maps</span>. You must import all of the maps you want to teleport to or else the teleporter will not function. It needs the destination to exist after all.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">List of Rooms/Features</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">NOTE ON CUSTOMIZING THE ROOM ORDER: Some rooms naturally link up with staircases while others don't. If you would like to use a different order of rooms, or leave some out entirely, you can do that! You will have to change any teleport linkages, of course. And if you run into a situation where staircases don't line up, just use the <strong>Deployable Teleporter token</strong> in your Actor compendium as a hack to get your players where they need to go next!</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL01: Entrance: A large room, flexible enough to furnish or leave empty. A staircase leads upwards, and a subtle teleport hotspot can receive tokens teleporting from elsewhere to here. You have multiple options for a foundation to your tower. <strong>To change the base of the tower, watch the walkthrough video</strong>!</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL02: Magic Room: a mysterious arcane power emanates from the pool surrounding this room. Another teleport pad waits to receive</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL03: Guest Rooms: A handful of bedrooms, a secret teleportation room behind a metal door, and a couple other rooms that seem to be used for spying through the pictures or mirrors in the bedrooms.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL04: Library: Tall shelves of books and a few arcane artifacts tip off that a mage does their studying here.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL05: Dining Room: A decidedly magical dining experience with floating candles and a balcony to survey the surrounding landscape.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL06: Portal Room: 4 Portals to who-knows-where. Are these even active anymore? Right-click the portal light to turn the portal on/off. Double-click it to change the color.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL07: Scrying Pool: The tiles around the pool are worn away. Maybe from the magic essence of the pool. Or maybe from the endless of hours someone has stood staring into the secrets of the world.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL08: Laboratory: Something sinister is happening here. Why are there footprints coming from that empty tank over there?</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL09: Beasts and Cages: Our good mage has been keeping something in here. Or something got out.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL10: Lair: Something lurks in that bone-covered cave. And the empty chains on the walls imply it's been well fed.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL11: Bedroom: This is literally where the magic happens. Between the magical dressing room to the floating wardrobe, this room has ample opportunity for mahem and discovery.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">LVL12: Roof(s): You have two options for a roof: A castle roof with arcane sigils protecting from intrudors, or a normal shingled roof to top off the tower.</p>","img":"","_id":"mK3o8THqGuVnPTAl"}

This map is available initially as a \"<strong>Single Map</strong>\". While I can deploy it as a multi-scene map, a&nbsp;Single Map might be better for combat and to cut down on load times for your players. Plus it lets you control weather and lighting from one map instead of 6 of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Modules in Use</span>: <strong>Multilevel Token</strong> hotspots are in place, including the Hold, the Decks and the ocean.

Some on the Decks and a big zone in the water. You can place actors anywhere on this Main Deck screen, and they will \"project\" to the same spot from other screens. This way your players can see each other and enemies from anywhere on the ship (assuming line of sight). You should also be able to target these clones in combat (if you're using the Single Map version). <strong>It is important that you don't drop Actors directly in the \"projected\" hotspots</strong>. They won't project to other areas, and you may lose track of where you put them. Just drop them into the Main Deck screen or one of the rooms.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Special Use of Ambient Sounds</span>: In each level of the Galleon you can hear sailing sounds whenever you select a token.
