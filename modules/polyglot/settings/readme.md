# Settings

If you want to add language systems for new scenario settings just use the json files here as templates.

- For every alphabet you need to specify its font and size, as in `120% Dethek`;
- For every tongue (system language) you need to specify wich alphabet it uses;
- Use a `_default` alphabet to specify the font which everything non-categorized will fall into.

## Adding new fonts

If you need new fonts for a specific setting or want some font changed, mind the following:

- The license of the font you are trying to implement, we won't commit fonts without specified origin, even if its unlicensed we need the source;
- Fan art fonts are ok as long as they comply with the Fan Content Policy, so please provive this too.
